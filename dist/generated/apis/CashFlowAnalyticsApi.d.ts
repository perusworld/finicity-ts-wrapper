Calculated metrics include: * Average transaction value by month over the requested time period * Net cash flow over the requested time period and broken down by month * Count and report of weeks in the requested time period where there   were zero transactions posted to the customer\'s accounts  * Minimum/maximum/average/sum/count of deposits by month * Minimum/maximum/average/sum/count of withdrawals by month * Estimated amount of deposits that can be classified as business   revenue  * Number of transactions posted incurring a non-sufficient funds (NSF)   fee, and net amount charged in NSF fees   This version of the API is intended for piloting and integration testing your application with the Cash Flow Analytics product. It does not adhere to FCRA requirements, and should not be used for production/lending purposes. See _Generate Cash Flow Analytics - FCRA_ for the FCRA compliant version of this API.
